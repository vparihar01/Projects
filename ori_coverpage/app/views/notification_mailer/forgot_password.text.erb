Dear <%= @name %>,

At your request, <%= CONFIG[:app_name] %> has reset your password. If it was not at your request, then you should be aware that someone has entered your email address as theirs in the forgotten password section of <%= CONFIG[:app_name] %>.

New password: <%= @password %>

We advise you to change your password as soon as you can. It's as simple as navigating to 'Account' and clicking on 'Change Password'.

<%= change_password_url %>
